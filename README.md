A simple Windows batch script that allows users to block or unblock access to specific websites by editing the system's `hosts` file. Useful for staying focused, preventing distractions, or controlling access.


## ğŸ›  Requirements

- âœ… Windows OS
- âœ… Admin privileges

---

## ğŸ“¦ Features

- ğŸ”’ Block any domain (e.g., `facebook.com`)
- ğŸ”“ Unblock previously blocked domains
- ğŸš€ Instantly applies changes using DNS flush
- ğŸ’¡ Smart input (prevents using full URLs like `https://`)

## ğŸ’» How It Works

The script redirects specified domains to `127.0.0.1` in the `hosts` file, making the website unreachable. Unblocking removes the entries.

1. **Run the script as Administrator**
2. Follow the menu options:
3. **Only enter domain names** (e.g., `instagram.com`, not `https://instagram.com`)
4. Done!
